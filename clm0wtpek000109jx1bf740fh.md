Welcome to my blog! My name is Brian and I am currently a masterâ€™s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Western University. I love technology and have tinkered with many devices from a young age.

This blog is therefore a space for me to share my learnings and experiences as I work and build on my knowledge through notes, tutorials and projects. These will include but are not limited to best practices, tips and tricks, challenges and solutions that I will encounter across the following topics.

* **DevOps** - is a set of practices that aims to improve the collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations teams, as well as automation and streamlining of software delivery.
    
* **Cloud Computing** - is the delivery of services such as servers, computing, storage, databases, networking and analytics over the Internet.
    
* **Data Engineering** - is the process of designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines that transform raw data into useful information for analysis and decision-making.
    

It is also a challenge for myself, as the idea of having a blog is one I have danced around for years. Analysis paralysis beware! Hopefully, expression through writing will improve how I articulate concepts and deepen my love for the many topics in tech.

I hope to not only improve my own understanding, but also inspire and assist others who share the same curiosity. Feedback is most welcome for corrections, comments, questions and suggestions. Thank you for reading and stay tuned for more posts! ðŸ˜Š
